# 👋 Hi, I'm Alex

I'm a developer passionate about **systems programming**, **Rust**, and the inner workings of computing. I’m currently building my own operating system in Rust from scratch — not just as an academic exercise, but as a way to master low-level development and understand how software truly interacts with hardware.

At the same time, I’m actively expanding my skills in **web development**, aiming to bridge the gap between high-level and low-level systems. I believe in writing clean, efficient, and well-structured code — whether it runs in the browser or on bare metal.
