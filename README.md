# Hi there, I'm Alejandro 👋

I'm a self-taught developer passionate about **Rust**, **Linux**, and low-level systems programming. I enjoy learning how things work under the hood and building efficient, robust software from the ground up.

Currently, I spend most of my time exploring the Rust ecosystem, contributing to open source, and experimenting with tools that push me closer to the metal. I'm particularly interested in systems programming, developer tooling, and performance optimization.
